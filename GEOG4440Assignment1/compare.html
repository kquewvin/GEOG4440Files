            When viewing the maps side by side, you can easily make a distinction of the temporal and spatial differences between these two images. 
            Firstly, I would like to mention that both these images were taken in March within the early spring season. However, by observing these 
            images, it seems that the 2021 image appears to have more vegetation coverage compared to the 2002 image despite having more developed infrastrucure.<br><br> 
            Unfortunately, I was unable to perform an NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) analysis to quantify vegetation greenness to gather information 
            about vegetation density and plant health. An NDVI analysis essentially measures the reflected red and near-infrared electromagnetic wavelengths from plant chlorophyll. 
            Because plants are generally good absorbers of visible light - except green (500-570 nm) - and good reflectors for infrared light, we can 
            infer that healthy and high densities of vegetation would result in a higher NDVI value. The images I obtained only provided bands within the visible spectrum.<br><br>
            There have been multiple urban development and expansion on and off campus. Most notably of the Sobeys Stadium, York University's very own TTC 
            station, Pioneer Village Station, York Lions Stadium, the Quad Residence, Bergeron Centre, expansion of Stong Pond, and many more. It will be interesting 
            to see how urban developments such as cities can continue to grow while pertaining to environmental protection policies. One being
