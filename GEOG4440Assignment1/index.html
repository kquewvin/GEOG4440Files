        <p><br>The purpose of this website is for me to apply my beginner-level knowledge of programming/web development to my formal education in environmental studies
            and geospatial analysis for this course. As the Winter term continues, I plan to update this site periodically with completed assignments related to spatial
            analysis and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
            <br><br>
            Sources I used to find free remote sensing data and imagery:
            <br>
            <a href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/" class="web_links" target="_blank" rel="norefferer noopener">USGS Earth Explorer</a><br>
            The United States Geological Survey provides geographic data about Earth's land, water, and atmosphere. It collects, monitors, and analyzes scientific data to
            understand natural processes. It is an open access portal for downloading free aerial imagery, including digital elevation models, Landsat, LiDAR, MODIS, and more.
            <br><br>
            <a href="https://geo1.scholarsportal.info" class="web_links" target="_blank" rel="norefferer noopener">Scholars Geoportal</a><br>
            The Scholars GeoPortal provides access to large scale geospatial datasets. It allows for searching, discovery, and visualization to make data about Ontario<br> for the public. 
            <br><br>
            <a href="https://open.toronto.ca" class="web_links" target="_blank" rel="norefferer noopener">City of Toronto - Open Data</a><br>
            The City of Toronto's open data portal provides free and downloadable information about the city. Accessible data can vary broadly from textual data like census reports<br>
            to geospatial data about infrastructure, planning, and boudaries.
            <br><br>
            <a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Missions/Sentinel-2/(result_type)/images" class="web_links" target="_blank" rel="norefferer noopener">Sentinel 2 Archive</a><br>
            Provides open access to EU Copernicus Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-5P aerial data.
            <br><br>
            <a href="http://nsidc.org/data" class="web_links" target="_blank" rel="norefferer noopener">National Snow and Ice Data Centre</a><br>
            Provides open access to cryospheric and geophysical data. It is suitable for identifying changes to global snow coverage, detection, and temporal changes in the environment.
            <br><br>

        <h2>Data Acquisition</h2>
        <div class="image-link-container">
            <!-- First image hyperlink-->
            <img src="map_scope.png" alt="scope" style="width:auto;height:10cm;">
        </div>
        <p>The dataset that I decided to use was obtained through the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (2002) and First Base Solutions (2021) on Scholars GeoPortal's
            open data hub. The scope of this area was selected using the polygon clipping tool that is available to use by selecting to download by an area of interest.
            I am particularly interested in urban development and expansion of cities. As such, I found and selected data that is most revelant to my research. 
            York University's Keele campus was my area of interest for this assignment because the campus is located within the center of the Greater Toronto Area and
            just north of the Toronto metropolis, bordering the York region. The University has undergone various development and changes within the past two decades and is
            still continuing development.

            <img src="translate.png" alt="translate" style="width:auto;height:10cm;">
        </div>
        <p>After downloading the data, I had to open each individual .tif file into CATALYST Professional. The original .tif files were incompatible with CATALYST 
            and so I had to use the translate tool to convert them into PCIDSK (.pix) files and export the entire dataset as one file. I did this for both maps.
